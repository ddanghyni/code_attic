# 🧠 code_attic

A personal code archive for statistical computing, data processing,  
and research-oriented implementations in Python.

## 📌 About

`code_attic` is a personal repository where I collect and organize  
Python code snippets, implementations, and experiments developed during  
my **M.S. studies in Statistics**.

This repository serves both as:

- a **technical notebook** for reusable code patterns, and  
- a **research sandbox** for implementing ideas from papers and coursework.

The focus is not on polished libraries, but on **clarity, correctness, and reproducibility**.

## 📂 Contents

### 1. Python Fundamentals & Tricks
- Basic → intermediate → advanced Python syntax
- Language features, idioms, and edge cases
- Small but useful tricks discovered through practice



---

### 2. Data Processing & Manipulation
Core tools for statistical data analysis and preprocessing:

- **NumPy** – numerical computing foundations  
- **Pandas** – tabular data handling and analysis  
- **Polars** – high-performance DataFrame operations  


Focus areas:
- efficient preprocessing
- time-series handling
- memory- and speed-aware operations

---

### 3. Deep Learning (PyTorch)
PyTorch-based implementations related to my research interests:

- not update yetttt.....



---

### 4. Paper Implementations
Re-implementations of algorithms from academic papers:

- faithful reproduction of core ideas
- emphasis on mathematical correctness
- minimal but interpretable code




---

### 5. Anomaly Detection (Primary Research Area)
Code related to **anomaly detection**, my main research focus:

- statistical and probabilistic methods
- reconstruction-based models
- representation-based and deep learning approaches
- experiments on synthetic and real-world data


---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Maintain a **structured archive** of ideas and implementations  
- Support **research reproducibility**
- Accumulate reusable code for future projects and publications

This repository is expected to evolve continuously as my research progresses.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Code quality may vary depending on experimental purpose
- Some implementations are exploratory rather than optimized
- Contents are subject to frequent refactoring
